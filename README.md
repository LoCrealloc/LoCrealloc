## Hey, I am LoC, a student and nerd who loves to code, from Germany!

### Okay, now really, who am I?

I am, like I already told you, a guy with a passion for computer science in general and programming in particular. I started teaching myself via the internet (especially using YouTube) when I was 13. I think programming is a great possibility to learn new skills and use them for making your life easier, for example with scripts which automates stuff you dont want to do.
The first thing I ever developed was an application for my Casio fx-cg20 graphic calculator. I had to write it in C, and it was hell for me, but it was really cool to show off with this program in school. Later, I started to learn Python, which is still my favourite language.
